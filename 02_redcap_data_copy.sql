-- @source_project = 64 -- Source project ID
-- @target_project = 68 -- Target project ID
-- @DAG_ids = (5319, 5457) -- DAG IDs in the source project owning records to be copied
-- The script will copy all records into the Target project
-- the scripts will be in appropriate DAGs, as that was already determined in redcap_record_list
-- but the interface will not present the DAG info, as that needs to be duplicately stored in redcap_data
-- as well, as is done in the next script.
-- The next script will move them into DAGs
