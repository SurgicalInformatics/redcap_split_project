These scripts can be used to split up a large REDCap into separate smaller ones based on Data Access Groups (DAGs).

Take an empty copy of the project including Roles, but not including Records or Users. Alternatively, create a copy by uploading the project XML. 

Then read the instructions at the top of each numbered script or the regional ones (that combine 01-04 into a single file).
