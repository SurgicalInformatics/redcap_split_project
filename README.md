These scripts can be used to split up a large REDCap into separate smaller onces based on Data Access Groups (DAGs).

`00_redcap_project_data_tables.sql` is just for investigating and double checking the structure.

Before running `01_-...` take an empty copy of the project including Roles, but not including Records or Users. Alternatively, create a copy by uploading the project XML.

Then read the instructions at the top of each numbered script.

Moving users TODO.
